# CreateYourFlashCards
i builded this app just for use repository layer.


this app is basic example for using MVVM and repository layer.

also i tried to use combine framework for passing data between layers, also this app dependency injection,

after all of them there is a little unit test of course.

i have want to try myself about, repository layer, combine, dependency injection and unit testing.

UI pages are not prety cool, but it wasnt a goal for this app, just want to test myself.

and it works :)
